# Imabalanced_Binary_Classification

This was a personal project exploring imbalanced binary classification. I've performed binary classification using Logistic Regression, XGBoost Classification and Decision Tree Classification models, training my models using 5 fold cross validation, tuning hyperparameters on the F1 macro score. I then explored the impact of different sampling and dimensionality reduction techniques, comparing results for multiple metrics.
