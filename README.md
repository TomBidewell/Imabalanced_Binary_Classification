# Imabalanced_Binary_Classification

Hi! I'm Tom Bidewell, a 3rd year Mathematics student at the University of Warwick. Thank you for considering my application. This was a university project exploring imbalanced binary classification. The data holds no real world signficance and was created just for this task. I've performed binary classification using Logistic Regression, XGBoost Classification and Decision Tree Classification models, training my models using 5 fold cross validation, maximising hyperparameters on the F1 macro score. I then explored the impact of different sampling and dimensionality reduction techniques, comparing results for multiple metrics.
